It is said that during that conflict, the CIA put a $5000 reward on the first to deliver to them a fully functional AK74, as this was the first time they've been used in active service. The AK74U is a carbine version. The easiest way to identify an AK74 apart from an AK47 is a longer barrel and the addition of a flash eliminator.",
